        <p>"Those who are “self-directed”, or who do not incorporate god to solve problems, are negatively associated with guilt. Whereas those who see god as a partner or the sole problem solver are more prone to guilt."<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1387151"> Religious Problem Styles and Guilt by DONN L KAISER</a></p>

        <p>Explanation: You can experience unhealthy guilt over things that you weren’t in control of.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col border border-dark bg-danger">
        <p>"Unhealthy guilt comes from telling yourself a lie. When the wounded, programmed critical part of you takes over and tells you that doing what you want with no intent to harm anyone is wrong, that is when you will feel unhealthy guilt.Unhealthy guilt also arises when someone blames you for his or her feelings and you take on the blame. Many people have learned to blame others for their feelings rather than take responsible for their own feelings. When you accept this blame, it is because you want to believe that you can control others' feelings. You will feel unhealthy guilt when you accept blame for others' feelings."<a href= "https://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/1364/healthy-guilt-unhealthy-guilt.html">Guilt by Dr Margaret Paul </a> </p>
