<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
        Many students are deeply struggling with mental health due to stay-at-home orders, and there are many cascading consequences that are affecting both their health and hygiene. Students who suffer from poor mental health may find it difficult to do simple daily tasks like brushing their teeth.

        <h3>Need statement</h3>
        Teenagers who suffer from poor mental health need a way to take care of their personal hygiene in a comfortable and unburdensome way so they can maintain a baseline of health and hygiene.

          <ul>
            <li> A lot of people struggle to do basic hygiene tasks when depressed. This can include showering, washing their hands, brushing their teeth, doing laundry, or brushing their hair. “They report not having enough energy to do simple self-care tasks, such as brushing their teeth or washing their hair,” says Melissa A. Jones, PhD, HSPP, a clinical psychologist based in Indiana. “Many of them do not take care of their personal hygiene needs unless they are reminded by a family member to do so.”

      <div class="col px-3 py-3 pt-2">
        <ul>
          <li> The physical symptoms of depression, such as physical pain, can also cause people to avoid showering. “Depressed individuals will also experience physical pain, along with their depressive symptoms, causing them to not feel physically able to care for their personal hygiene needs,”
